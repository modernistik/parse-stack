module Parse
=begin
  This is the core class for all app specific Parse table subclasses. This class
  in herits from Parse::Pointer since an Object is a Parse::Pointer with additional fields,
  at a minimum, created_at, updated_at and ACLs.
  This class also handles all the relational types of associations in a Parse application and
  handles the main CRUD operations.

  Most Pointers and Object subclasses are treated the same. Therefore, defining a class Artist < Parse::Object
  that only has `id` set, will be treated as a pointer. Therefore a Parse::Object can be in a "pointer" state
  based on the data that it contains. Becasue of this, it is possible to take a Artist instance
  (in this example), that is in a pointer state, and fetch the rest of the data for that particular
  record without having to create a new object. Doing so would now mark it as not being a pointer anymore.
  This is important to the understanding on how relations and properties are handled.

  The implementation of this class is large and has been broken up into several modules.

  Properties:
  All columns in a Parse object are considered a type of property (ex. string, numbers, arrays, etc)
  except in two cases - Pointers and Relations. For the list of basic supported data types, please see the
  Properties module variable Parse::Properties::TYPES . When defining a property,
  dynamic methods are created that take advantage of all the ActiveModel
  plugins (dirty tracking, callbacks, json, etc).

  Associations (BelongsTo):
  This module adds support for creating an association between one object to another using a
  Parse object pointer. By defining a belongs_to relationship in a specific class, it implies
  that the remote Parse table contains a local column, which has a pointer, referring to another
  Parse table.

  Associations (HasMany):
  In Parse there are two ways to deal with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
  One is through an array of pointers (which is recommended to be less than 100) and
  through an intermediary table called a Relation (or a Join table in other languages.)
  The way Parse::Objects treat these associations different from defining a :property of array type, is
  by making sure items in the array as of a particular class cast type.

  Querying:
  The querying module provides all the general methods to be able to find and query a specific
  Parse table.

  Fetching:
  The fetching modules supports fetching data from Parse (depending on the state of the object),
  and providing some autofetching features when traversing relational objects and properties.

  Schema:
  The schema module provides methods to modify the Parse table remotely to either add or create
  any locally define properties in ruby and have those be reflected in the Parse application.
