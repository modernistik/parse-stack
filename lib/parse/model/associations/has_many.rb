  module Associations

    # Parse has many ways to implement one-to-many and many-to-many
    # associations: `Array`, `Parse Relation` or through a `Query`. How you decide
    # to implement your associations, will affect how `has_many` works in
    # Parse-Stack. Parse natively supports one-to-many and many-to-many
    # relationships using `Array` and `Relations`, as described in
    # {http://docs.parseplatform.org/js/guide/#relations Parse Relational Data}.
    # Both of these methods require you define a specific column type in your
    # Parse table that will be used to store information about the association.
    #
    # In addition to `Array` and `Relation`, Parse-Stack also implements the
    # standard `has_many` behavior prevalent in other frameworks through a query
    # where the associated class contains a foreign pointer to the local class,
    # usually the inverse of a `belongs_to`. This requires that the associated
    # class has a defined column that contains a pointer the refers to the
    # defining class.
    #
    # *Query-Approach*
    #
    # In this `Query` implementation, a `has_many` association for a Parse class
    # requires that another Parse class will have a foreign pointer that refers
    # to instances of this class. This is the standard way that `has_many`
    # relationships work in most databases systems. This is usually the case when
    # you have a class that has a `belongs_to` relationship to instances of the
    # local class.
    #
    # In the example below, many songs belong to a specific artist. We set this
    # association by setting {Associations::BelongsTo.belongs_to :belongs_to} relationship from `Song` to `Artist`.
    # Knowing there is a column in `Song` that points to instances of an `Artist`,
    # we can setup a `has_many` association to `Song` instances in the `Artist`
    # class. Doing so will generate a helper query method on the `Artist` instance
    # objects.
    #
    #  class Song < Parse::Object
    #    property :released, :date
    #    # this class will have a pointer column to an Artist
    #    belongs_to :artist
    #  end
    #
    #  class Artist < Parse::Object
    #    has_many :songs
    #  end
    #
    #  artist = Artist.first
    #
    #  artist.songs # => [all songs belonging to artist]
    #  # equivalent: Song.all(artist: artist)
    #
    #  # filter also by release date
    #  artist.songs(:released.after => 1.year.ago)
    #  # equivalent: Song.all(artist: artist, :released.after => 1.year.ago)
    #
    # In order to modify the associated objects (ex. `songs`), you must modify
    # their corresponding `belongs_to` field (in this case `song.artist`), to
    # another record and save it.
    #
    # Options for `has_many` using the `Query` approach are `:as` and `:field`. The
    # `:as` option behaves similarly to the {Associations::BelongsTo.belongs_to :belongs_to} counterpart. The
    # `:field` option can be used to override the derived column name located
    # in the foreign class. The default value for `:field` is the columnized
    # version of the Parse subclass `parse_class` method.
    #
    #  class Parse::User
    #    # since the foreign column name is :agent
    #    has_many :artists, field: :agent
    #  end
    #
    #  class Artist < Parse::Object
    #    belongs_to :manager, as: :user, field: :agent
    #  end
    #
    #  artist.manager # => Parse::User object
    #
    #  user.artists # => [artists where :agent column is user]
    #
    #
    # When using this approach, you may also employ the use of scopes to filter the particular data from the `has_many` association.
    #
    #  class Artist
    #    has_many :songs, ->(timeframe) { where(:created_at.after => timeframe) }
    #  end
    #
    #  artist.songs(6.months.ago)
    #  # => [artist's songs created in the last 6 months]
    #
    # You may also call property methods in your scopes related to the instance.
    # *Note:* You also have access to the instance object for the local class
    # through a special "*i*" method in the scope.
    #
    #  class Concert
    #    property :city
    #    belongs_to :artist
    #  end
    #
    #  class Artist
    #    property :hometown
    #    has_many :local_concerts, -> { where(:city => hometown) }, as: :concerts
    #  end
    #
    #  # assume
    #  artist.hometown = "San Diego"
    #
    #  # artist's concerts in their hometown of 'San Diego'
    #  artist.local_concerts
    #  # equivalent: Concert.all(artist: artist, city: artist.hometown)
    #
    # You may also omit the association completely, as rely on the scope to fetch the
    # associated records. This makes the `has_many` work as a macro query setting the :scope_only
    # option to true:
    #
    #  class Author < Parse::Object
    #    property :name
    #    has_many :posts, ->{ where :tags.in => name.downcase }, scope_only: true
    #  end
    #
    #  class Post < Parse::Object
    #    property :tags, :array
    #  end
    #
    #  author.posts # => Posts where author's name is a tag
    #  # equivalent: Post.all( :tags.in => artist.name.downcase )
    #
    # *Array-Approach*
    #
    # In the `Array` implemenatation, you can designate a column to be of `Array`
    # type that contains a list of Parse pointers. Parse-Stack supports this by
    # passing the option `through: :array` to the `has_many` method. If you use
    # this approach, it is recommended that this is used for associations where
    # the quantity is less than 100 in order to maintain query and fetch
    # performance. You would be in charge of maintaining the array with the proper
    # list of Parse pointers that are associated to the object. Parse-Stack does
    # help by wrapping the array in a {Parse::PointerCollectionProxy} which provides dirty tracking.
    #
    #  class Artist < Parse::Object
    #  end
    #
    #  class Band < Parse::Object
    #    has_many :artists, through: :array
    #  end
    #
    #  artist = Artist.first
    #
    #  # find all bands that contain this artist
    #  bands = Band.all( :artists.in => [artist.pointer] )
    #
    #  band = bands.first
    #  band.artists # => [array of Artist pointers]
    #
    #  # remove artists
    #  band.artists.remove artist
    #
    #  # add artist
    #  band.artists.add artist
    #
    #  # save changes
    #  band.save
    #
    # *ParseRelation-Approach*
    #
    # Other than the use of arrays, Parse supports native one-to-many and many-to-many
    # associations through what is referred to as a {http://docs.parseplatform.org/js/guide/#many-to-many Parse Relation}.
    # This is implemented by defining a column to be of type `Relation` which
    # refers to a foreign class. Parse-Stack supports this by passing the
    # `through: :relation` option to the `has_many` method. Designating a column
    # as a Parse relation to another class type, will create a one-way intermediate
    # "join-list" between the local class and the foreign class. One important
    # distinction of this compared to other types of data stores (ex. PostgresSQL) is that:
    #
    # *1*. The inverse relationship association is not available automatically. Therefore, having a column of `artists` in a `Band` class that relates to members of the band (as `Artist` class), does not automatically make a set of `Band` records available to `Artist` records for which they have been related. If you need to maintain both the inverse relationship between a foreign class to its associations, you will need to manually manage that by adding two Parse relation columns in each class, or by creating a separate class (ex. `ArtistBands`) that is used as a join table.
    #
    # *2*. Querying the relation is actually performed against the implicit join table, not the local one.
    #
    # *3*. Applying query constraints for a set of records within a relation is performed against the foreign table class, not the class having the relational column.
    #
    # The Parse documentation provides more details on associations, see {http://docs.parseplatform.org/ios/guide/#relations Parse Relations Guide}.
    # Parse-Stack will handle the work for (2) and (3) automatically.
    #
    # In the example below, a `Band` can have thousands of `Fans`. We setup a
    # `Relation<Fan>` column in the `Band` class that references the `Fan` class.
    # Parse-Stack provides methods to manage the relationship under the {Parse::RelationCollectionProxy}
    # class.
    #
    #  class Fan < Parse::Object
    #    # .. lots of properties ...
    #    property :location, :geopoint
    #  end
    #
    #  class Band < Parse::Object
    #    has_many :fans, through: :relationÂ 
    #  end
    #
    #  band = Band.first
    #
    #   # the number of fans in the relation
    #  band.fans.count
    #
    #  # get the first object in relation
    #  fan = bands.fans.first # => Parse::User object
    #
    #  # use `add` or `remove` to modify relations
    #  band.fans.add user
    #  bands.fans.remove user
    #
    #  # updates the relation as well as changes to `band`
    #  band.fans.save
    #
    #  # Find 50 fans who are near San Diego, CA
    #  downtown = Parse::GeoPoint.new(32.82, -117.23)
    #  fans = band.fans.all :location.near => downtown
    #
    # You can perform atomic additions and removals of objects from `has_many`
    # relations using the methods below. Parse allows this by providing a specific atomic operation
    # request. The operation is performed directly on Parse server
    # and *NOT* on your instance object.
    #
    #  # atomically add/remove
    #  band.artists.add! objects  # { __op: :AddUnique }
    #  band.artists.remove! objects  # { __op: :AddUnique }
    #
    #  # atomically add unique Artist
    #  band.artists.add_unique! objects  # { __op: :AddUnique }
    #
    #  # atomically add/remove relations
    #  band.fans.add! users # { __op: :Add }
    #  band.fans.remove! users # { __op: :Remove }
    #
    #  # atomically perform a delete operation on this field name
    #  # this should set it as `undefined`.
    #  band.op_destroy!("category") # { __op: :Delete }
    #
    # You can also perform queries against class entities to find related objects. Assume
    # that users can like a band. The `Band` class can have a `likes` column that is
    # a Parse relation to the {Parse::User} class containing the users who have liked a
    # specific band.
    #
    #
    #   class Band < Parse::Object
    #     # likes is a Parse relation column of user objects.
    #     has_many :likes, through: :relation, as: :user
    #   end
    #
    # You can now find all {Parse::User} records who have liked a specific band. In the
    # example below, the `:likes` key refers to the `likes` column defined in the `Band`
    # collection which contains the set of user records.
    #
    #   band = Band.first # get a band
    #
    #   # find all users who have liked this band, where :likes is a column
    #   # in the Band collection - NOT in the User collection.
    #   users = Parse::User.all :likes.related_to => band
    #
    # You can also find all bands that a specific user has liked.
    #
    #   user = Parse::User.first
    #
    #   # find all bands where this user
    #   # is in the `likes` column of the Band collection
    #   bands_liked_by_user = Band.all :likes => user

      # @param [Proc] scope Only applicable using :query. A proc that can customize the query by applying

      # @option opts [Symbol] :through The type of implementation to use: :query (default), :array or :relation.
      #  If set to `:array`, it defines the column in Parse as being an array of
      #  Parse pointer objects and will be managed locally using a {Parse::PointerCollectionProxy}.
      #  If set to `:relation`, it defines a column of type Parse Relation with
      #  the foreign class and will be managed locally using a {Parse::RelationCollectionProxy}.
      #  If set to `:query`, no storage is required on the local class as the
      #  associated records will be fetched using a Parse query.

      #  When using through :query, this is the column name of the remote column

        # has_many :likes, as: :users, through: :relation
        # has_many :artists, field: "managedArtists"
        # The first item in the has_many is the name of the local attribute. This will create
        # several methods for accessing the relation type. By default, the remote column name
        # relating to this attribute will be the lower-first-camelcase version of this key.
        # Ex. a relation to :my_songs, would imply that the remote column name is "mySongs". This behavior
        # can be overriden by using the field: option and passing the literal field name in the Parse table.
        # This allows you to use a local attribute name while still having a different remote column name.
        # Since these types of collections are of a particular "type", we will assume that the name of the
        # key is the plural version of the name of the local camelized-named class. Ex. If the property is named :songs, then
        # we will assume there is a local class name defined as 'Song'. This can be overriden by using the as: parameter.
